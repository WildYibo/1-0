    "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",

    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
